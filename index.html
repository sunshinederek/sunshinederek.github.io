    <h3>The Joy of Dancing!</h3>
    <p>Dancing has been a joy for me since I started school here at Fresno City College.  Many times it was the only reason I wanted to come to school.  I enjoy all types of dance styles.</p>

          <h4>Hip Hop</h4>
          <h5>(Spring 2017)</h5>
          <p>My first and favorite dance class taken here at Fresno City College was Hip Hop, taken with instructor Cristal Tiscareno, who is a fanstastic dance instructor.  This is class became an outlet for me when I was taking 15 units.</p>

          <h4>Modern Dance</h4>
          <h5>(Fall 2017) </h5>
          <p>Although this was my second dance class and one of my least favorite dance styles, I met lots of great people, had loads of fun, and learned a great deal about dance.  This class was also taken with Cristal Tiscareno.</p>

          <h4>Jazz Dance</h4>
          <h5>(My Second Favorite)</h5>
          <p>I have not tried any Jazz dance classes, but I would love to.  Jazz is my second favorite dance style.  At one point I tried to register for a Jazz class with Cristal Tiscareno but sadly it did not fit with my class schedule.</p>

        <div class="vienna">
          <h4>Salsa Dance</h4>
          <h5>(Leisure/Fun)</h5>
          <p>I currently attend Elephant Lounges Salsa Dance Nights most Fridays.  It is something I do leisurely and for fun.  I consider myself a decent salsa dancer but much improvement is needed.</p>

          <h4>African Dance</h4>
          <h5>(A New Found Desire)</h5>
          <p>I've been recently exposed to a dance studio who offers African Dance classes.  I've never been interested in African Dance, but after watching the students perform, I believe I've developed a love for this particular genre.</p>
